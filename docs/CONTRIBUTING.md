# Contributing to DBMSBenchmarker

You would like to contribute? Great!

Some things that you can help on include:
* **New Workloads**: The `example/` folder includes the TPC-H and TPC-DS (reading) queries in various dialects. We are interested in adding other relevant workloads.
* **Documentation**: If a point in the documentation is unclear, we look forward to receiving tips and suggestions for improvement.
* **Testing**: If the behavior is not as expected and you suspect a bug, please report it to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Beuth-Erdelt/DBMS-Benchmarker/issues).
* **Use Cases**: If you have had any experiences with peculiarities, mistakes, ambiguities or oddities or particularly beautiful cases etc., we are interested in hearing about them and passing them on to others.

## Non-code contributions

Even if you don’t feel ready or able to contribute code, you can still help out. There always things that can be improved on the documentation (even just proof reading, or telling us if a section isn’t clear enough).
