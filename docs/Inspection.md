# Inspector

There is a Python interface to access all details about the experiment.
See the [rendered example](https://beuth-erdelt.github.io/DBMS-Benchmarker/Evaluation-Demo.html) for more details.

There are also debug tools and helper tools.

Run `dbmsinspect -r ~/benchmarks -c 1730998769 -q 4` to inspect the differences between all benchmarked DBMS of an experiment (here: for query 4).

# Debug Tool

There is a debug tool, that helps to analyze result folders: `python evaluate.py -h`

```
usage: evaluate.py [-h] [-r RESULT_FOLDER] [-e EXPERIMENT] [-q QUERY] [-c CONNECTION] [-n NUM_RUN] [-d] [-rt] {resultsets,errors,warnings,query}

A debug tool for DBMSBenchmarker. It helps to analyze a result folder. It depends on the evaluation cube, so that cube must have been created before.

positional arguments:
  {resultsets,errors,warnings,query}
                        show debug infos about which part of the outcome

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r RESULT_FOLDER, --result-folder RESULT_FOLDER
                        folder for storing benchmark result files, default is given by timestamp
  -e EXPERIMENT, --experiment EXPERIMENT
                        code of experiment
  -q QUERY, --query QUERY
                        number of query to inspect
  -c CONNECTION, --connection CONNECTION
                        name of DBMS to inspect
  -n NUM_RUN, --num-run NUM_RUN
                        number of run to inspect
  -d, --diff            show differences in result sets
  -rt, --remove-titles  remove titles when comparing result sets
 ```

It depends on the evaluation cube. In case, it can be generated by `dbmsbenchmarker -e yes -r 1647993954 read` for example for experiment `1647993954`.

## Show Queries

We can take a look at the sent queries: `python evaluate.py -e 1647993954 -q 1 -n 0 query`

This shows the query string for query number 2, first run.

## Show Result Sets

We can take a look at the received data: `python evaluate.py -e 1647993954 -q 2 resultsets`

This shows the result sets for query number 2.

## Show Errors

We can take a look at the errors: `python evaluate.py -e 1647993954 errors`

## Show Warnings

We can take a look at the warnings: `python evaluate.py -e 1647993954 warnings`
