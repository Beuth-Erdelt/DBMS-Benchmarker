abstract="Performance benchmarking of Database Management Systems (DBMS) is an important yet complicated process. We motivate and present two supporting Python packages which help to avoid common pitfalls and in particular improve reproducibility and transparency in heterogeneous systems with hardware accelerators. The first addresses operational aspects by providing dynamic testbeds using Docker images, especially for cloud-based systems. The second helps planning and recurrently running experiments in a predefined setup via JDBC/SQL, and analyzing results with automated reports and an interactive dashboard. The purpose of this is to thoroughly evaluate aspects of performances of DBMS based on real-life measurements, runtime and hardware metrics, depending on various parameters including the hardware, and with high repeatability. We present a series of TPC-H inspired example benchmarks in a Kubernetes cluster for demonstration, and some lessons learned.",

abstract="Containerization has become a common practise in software provisioning. Kubernetes (K8s) is useful in deploying containers in clusters, in managing their lifecycle, in scheduling and resource allocation. The benchmarking process requires the interaction of various components. We propose a way to organize benchmarking in the Cloud by looking at typical components in the process and ask if they could be managed by K8s as containerized Microservices. We aim at scalability for the process, parallelized execution and minimized traffic I/O from and into the Cloud. This supports planning a series of experiments to investigate a high-dimensional parameter space and avoiding complex installations. This also provides a way for Cross-Cloud comparison.",

abstract="The database landscape has significantly evolved over the last decade as cloud computing enables to run distributed databases on virtually unlimited cloud resources. Hence, the already non-trivial task of selecting and deploying a distributed database system becomes more challenging. Database evaluation frameworks aim at easing this task by guiding the database selection and deployment decision. The evaluation of databases has evolved as well by moving the evaluation focus from performance to distribution aspects such as scalability and elasticity. This paper presents a cloud-centric analysis of distributed database evaluation frameworks based on evaluation tiers and framework requirements. It analysis eight well adopted evaluation frameworks. The results point out that the evaluation tiers performance, scalability, elasticity and consistency are well supported, in contrast to resource selection and availability. Further, the analysed frameworks do not support cloud-centric requirements but support classic evaluation requirements.",

abstract="Benchmarking is a crucial aspect of evaluating database management systems. Researchers, developers, and users utilise industry-standard benchmarks to assist with their research, development, or purchase decisions, respectively. Despite this ubiquity, benchmarking is usually a difficult process involving laborious tasks such as writing and debugging custom testbed scripts, or extracting and transforming output into useful formats. To date, there are only a limited number of comprehensive benchmarking frameworks designed to tackle these usability and efficiency challenges directly.",
