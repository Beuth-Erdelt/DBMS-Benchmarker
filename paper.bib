abstract="Performance benchmarking of Database Management Systems (DBMS) is an important yet complicated process. We motivate and present two supporting Python packages which help to avoid common pitfalls and in particular improve reproducibility and transparency in heterogeneous systems with hardware accelerators. The first addresses operational aspects by providing dynamic testbeds using Docker images, especially for cloud-based systems. The second helps planning and recurrently running experiments in a predefined setup via JDBC/SQL, and analyzing results with automated reports and an interactive dashboard. The purpose of this is to thoroughly evaluate aspects of performances of DBMS based on real-life measurements, runtime and hardware metrics, depending on various parameters including the hardware, and with high repeatability. We present a series of TPC-H inspired example benchmarks in a Kubernetes cluster for demonstration, and some lessons learned.",

abstract="Containerization has become a common practise in software provisioning. Kubernetes (K8s) is useful in deploying containers in clusters, in managing their lifecycle, in scheduling and resource allocation. The benchmarking process requires the interaction of various components. We propose a way to organize benchmarking in the Cloud by looking at typical components in the process and ask if they could be managed by K8s as containerized Microservices. We aim at scalability for the process, parallelized execution and minimized traffic I/O from and into the Cloud. This supports planning a series of experiments to investigate a high-dimensional parameter space and avoiding complex installations. This also provides a way for Cross-Cloud comparison.",
